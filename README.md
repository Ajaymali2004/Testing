# Tasks

<h3><b>Note: You can make different branches with your name like Antriksh1, Antriksh2, Antriksh3 like this when needed.</b></h3>
<h3><b>You can also help each other with tasks, just make sure you learn everything and don't cheat ðŸ˜‡</b></h3>
### Task 0: Setup your local environment of git using git init

(Use fetch origin commands and research about and complete the task)
pull the main branch from the repo
pull the lazy branch
pull the newbranch branch


### Task 1: Basic Git Commands

Create a new branch in the repository with your own name (example: <branch name> = Antriksh)
Add a new file to the branch and commit the changes.
Push the branch to the remote repository.
Create a pull request (PR) to merge the branch into the main branch.


### Task 2: Collaborative Work

Collaborate with each other (Akash and Ajay), (Meet and Khushi)
Both collaborators should make changes to same file (<file name> = (Name1Name2) e.g. AkashAjay) simultaneously.
Resolve any merge conflicts that arise during this process.


### Task 3: Git History

Use git log to view the commit history of the repository.
Identify a specific commit by its hash and display its details.


### Task 4: Branching and Merging


Create a branch with your name.
Make multiple commits to the feature branch (atleast 3) (with your file names only).
Merge the feature branch into the main branch.


### Task 5: Merge Conflicts Resolution

Make two branches of your name and try to make merge conflicts.
And then merge one of them into another and resolve the merge conflict.


### Task 6: Gitignore

Add files ".DS_Store" , "node_modules", and ".env" into a branch named (<Name_Gitignore> e.g. Antriksh_Gitignore).
Create a .gitignore file in the repository to ignore specific files or directories.
Add common entries to ignore files like .DS_Store, node_modules/, and .env.
and then push the whole thing into your branch
